# go-play-bingo
- a user vs computer game
- learning go with bingo, or learning bingo with go? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
- just something simple i spent a few hours on the weekend on.
- I enjoy gambling games but absalutely hate gmabling with real money so programming bingo was fun.
- Learnt: Go Basics, structs, enums, loops, boolean logic, string formatting, maps, arryas, err != nil, etc
 # Conclusion: 
- Go is very simple, its insanely disorientating going from Rust to Go though, the structure of the "for" in Go is less verbose than Rust with it's iterators but still sufficient
- I think making this game in Go and learning the language was insanely efficient, couldn't have done it this fast if i were to MIB zap my memory of Rust and try to do this in same N hours as I did in Go
- I think I enjoy having Rust and Go in my pocket as 2 main languages of mine. If I want to "deliver" something quick from theory to production I'll use Go, otherwise Rust seems to be the play
- I heard Go is very nice for networking applicatoins so will try that one day.
